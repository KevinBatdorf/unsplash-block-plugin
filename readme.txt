Search from millions of stock photos, AI-generated imagry, textures, wallpapers, and more.

== Description ==

Unlimited Photos is a Gutenberg block plugin that integrates into the core image block, providing a way to view, search, and import over 3 million free-to-use photos, images, and digital art.

To use it, when adding a block, search for 'unlimited photos' or add an image block and press the blue camera icon.

Looking for that stock photo that perfectly matches your recipe, blog post, or news article? Or the perfect current event pic that describes exactly the intensity your story conveys? Writing a blog post for your business? Unlimited photos has exactly what you are looking for, for free.

Search AI-generated images built from platforms like stable diffusion, Dall-E, Midjourney, and more.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens when I deactivate this plugin? =

Nothing. We cleanly integrate into the image block, and when you import an image, we hand it off to the core block to manage. The images will always remain in your library and on your pages.

= Your server has a max upload size of =

This warning shows when your server has a restriction lower than 3MB. Many images provided at the "full" or "raw" quality are higher than this and therefore will fail when attempting to import. You should be able to contact your hosting provider to increase this value to something more reasonable like 25MB. To remove the warning, press the "Settings" button and select the "Regular" radio button to manually set the import size.
